## Description
This React project fetches data from an external API and displays it in a dynamic table format, allowing users to interactively search and filter the data. The search functionality enables users to find specific entries by title, while dropdown menus provide options to filter the data based on cost and popularity. Users can sort these filters in either ascending or descending order to view the results from high to low or low to high. 

Pagination is implemented to efficiently display a limited number of rows per page, with easy navigation controls for moving between pages. Each row in the table is clickable, providing access to detailed information about that entry in a modal or separate view. The project emphasizes a responsive, user-friendly design, ensuring it works seamlessly across devices while maintaining clear and accessible data presentation.
